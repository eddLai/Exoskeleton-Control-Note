面向"rehabilitation robotics"
Words:
- Proposed herein
- exoskeleton compensates for user dynamics
- **VO2水平**（氧氣攝取量）
- altered synergy patterns

Input: 2D-random variable
- muscle activity
- interaction torque

interaction portrait(IP) -> hybrid torque controller(HTC)
- kinematic state feedback
- novel adaptive model-based torque controller (AMTC)

> Online learning

---
time-based controller (TBC)\

Validation
- normalized oxygen uptake
- compared to running in normal shoes [10]
