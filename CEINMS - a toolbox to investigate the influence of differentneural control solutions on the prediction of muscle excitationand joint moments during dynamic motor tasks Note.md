EMG-driven and EMG-informed algorithms
- EMG-driven
- EMG-assisted
- static optimisation neural control solutions 

effection
- estimated joint moments
- muscle forces
- muscle excitations, including muscle co-contraction.

optimisation methods cannot predict the muscle co-contraction evident in the electromyography
