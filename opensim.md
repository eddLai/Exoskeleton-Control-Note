## Static Optimization(SO)
#### Goal
muscle activations and muscle forces that satisfy 
- positions
- velocities
- accelerations
- external forces

>***"static" means without integrating the equations of motion between time steps***

ignore activation dynamics and tendon compliance

---
#### Core Method
reduce actuation from reserve and residual actuators
#### Requirements
- smooth
- realistic accelerations
- all external forces
