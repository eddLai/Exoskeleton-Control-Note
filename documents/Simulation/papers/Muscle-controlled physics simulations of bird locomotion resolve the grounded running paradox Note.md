[[Muscle-controlled physics simulations of bird locomotion resolve the grounded running paradox.pdf]]
***"Humans and birds use very different running styles"***
ground contact
minimize locomotor energy expenditure
emu (Dromaius novaehollandiae)
optimal gait for birds on two perspectives, 
- energetics
- muscle excitations
### Terms and Good words
- paradox
- avian: relating to birds
- anatomical: 解剖學上
- metabolic cost of transport(MCOT); in joules per kilogram per meter
- midstance
- duty factor: 腳接觸地面的時間
- GRF: 地面反作用力

gait selection
- energy expenditure (2–6)
- center of mass (COM) movements (7, 8)
- neuromuscular factors (9–11),\
- gross morphology (12, 13)
- injury prevention (14),
- musculoskeletal stresses (15–18)

walk-­to-­run transition
- abrupt drop in duty factor (DF; fraction of the stride period that a foot is in contact with the ground) (Fig. 1B) (28, 29)
- grounded running gait; that is, a gait with no aerial phase (DF > 0.5) but with in-­phase COM oscillations (5, 13, 28, 30–32)

### 怪異點
Grounded running has higher energy costs than aerial running
- But increase stability
- COM不同

### Idea
ratites可以跑很快，那外骨骼可以幫助人類做到嗎？
discontinuity in DF，用來判斷人類走到跑步的階段
kinetic (EK) and potential energies (EP) of the COM are out of phase 能量交替
