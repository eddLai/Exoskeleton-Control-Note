## 摘要
ref. [[Muscle Fatigue Analysis Using OpenSim.pdf]]
- muscle capability的資料很重要: ***OpenSim*** and ***AnyBody*** 才有
- 加入accumulation effect的opensim plug-in
- recall: residual reduction algorithm用來使model接近真實實驗數據
- 不需要肌電圖的肌肉疲乏模擬
- fatigability($k$值)透過empirical maximal endurance models，可以相互確認sEMG計算所得是否正確

## Muscle fatigue mathematics description
$$\frac{dF_{cem}(t)}{dt}=-k\frac{F_{cem}(t)}{F_{max}}F_{Load}(t)$$

ref. **A new simple dynamic muscle fatigue model and its validation.**
Validated by static MET models.一個關注代謝的模型

---
### definition of fatigability 
includes intrinsic human attribute
>***"Muscle fatigability describes a tendency of a muscle from a given subject to get tired or exhausted, and it should only be determined by the physical and psychological properties of the individual subject"***

ref. Measurement of subject-speci c local muscle fatigabiltity

---
### Some characteristic
- females are found to be more fatigue-resistant than males
- older, much less force loss than the younger group after a certain exercises

ref. Sex differences with aging in the fatigability of dynamic contractions

---
## Apply in Opensim
Force-load muscle fatigue model

---
### workload on each muscle along the motion
muscle force generation phase

1. activation dynamics:
>"calcium release, diffusion and uptake from the sarcoplasmic reticulum",
>
>u is excitation; $$assume:Ca^+ \propto activation$$;
>$$\frac{da}{dt}=\frac{u-a}{\tau(u,a)}$$

---
2. contraction dynamics
	- force-length($l_m$)-velocity relationship$f_v$
	- elastic properties+tendon($l_mt$)	
	
	>$$\frac{dl_m}{t}=f_v^{-1}(l_m, l_{mt},a)$$

Opensim之CMC是用來推算series of muscles activation，得到Forward Dynamic Simulation

---
recall
- IK得到角度
- ==ID得到的關節總力會distribute joint force among a series of muscles==
### the maximal muscle capability
基於muscle force increases with muscle activation.
Full activation會被用於作為Fatigue計算之$F_{max}$

## Results

---
### Simulation setup
- 29 degree-of-freedom human model developed by Stanford
- 20 body segments, 19 joints and 92 muscle actuators
- inertial parameters for body segments based on average anthropometric data 
	- obtained from five subjects 
		- age 26 3 years
		- height 177 3 cm
		- weight 70.1 7.8 kg
- Subject: 
	- healthy male subject (height 1.83 m, mass 65.9 kg)
	- running (treadmill at 3.96 m/s.)
	- 10 muscles are selected from the three muscle groups

---
Proof that simulation能得到真實的情況
- the fatigability is set to $1.0 min^{-1}$. 
- Generally, the muscles capabilities reduce to 60% to 70% of their maximum after running for 10 min.
- torso-core muscle group fatigues no less than the pelvis-femur or the lower knee group
- 另外可以得到Workload

疲勞度 k 代表肌肉疲勞的傾向
k值需要calibration
"Fatigability k has been determined by comparing the Force-Load muscle fatigue model with the empirical maximal endurance models"
一般肌肉群的 k 值範圍從 0.87 min⁻¹ 到 2.15 min⁻¹

![[muscle force capabilities with different k.png]]

---
- erector spinae 最疲乏的
	- who loses 39.2% of its maximal capability
- torso-core，也並不少太多
	- contributing to body accelerating例如counterbalancing the vertical angular momentum of the legs
